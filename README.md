# SOLabsApp

Thesis project for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

This interactive web application consists of an Apache Web Server which the students will interact with, a Linux machine which will handle the execution of code using Docker containers and a MySQL Database server. Of course, the web server will limit the extent to which a certain student will have access to the Linux environment. Regarding the deployment, my application may use three separate machines or only one.
